### Script - cleanup.sh

This script cleans up your Docker ecosystem, including:

- All running containers;
- All images;
- All volumes;
- All custom networks.

### Functionality

1. The script checks if Docker is installed and exits if it isn't;
2. The script prompts the user to confirm whether they want to proceed with the cleaning process;
3. The script checks if there are any containers, images, volumes, or custom networks to delete;
4. The script proceeds to stop and delete all running containers, delete all images, delete all volumes, and delete all custom networks;
5. If any errors occur during the execution of the script, an error message is displayed, and the script is aborted.
